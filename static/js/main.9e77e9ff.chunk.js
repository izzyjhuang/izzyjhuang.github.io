Standing between two continents, I felt the immense weight of time and the quiet, steady movement of the earth beneath us. For lunch, we visited Fri\xf0heimar, an extraordinary greenhouse where geothermal energy and advanced technology make it possible to grow tomatoes year-round, despite Iceland\u2019s harsh climate. In the afternoon, we drove southeast from Reykjav\xedk to Rang\xe1r\xfeing Eystra, where sunlight pierced the cascading waters, revealing a brilliant rainbow.

As we strolled along Reynisfjara\u2019s Black Sand Beach, we let our binoculars and camera capture the distant flutter of puffins. We watched as they danced above the waves, diving into the ocean\u2019s depths before returning with beaks full of fish for their young. In the afternoon, we arrived at J\xf6kuls\xe1rl\xf3n, Iceland\u2019s largest and deepest glacial lagoon.
