A careless game of hide-and-seek left my dominant right fingers injured, and suddenly, I was thrust into a three-month “free trial” of living left-handed. Every day became an adventure in awkwardness—from brushing my teeth with fumbling fingers to scribbling words that barely resemble letters. What started as frustration, though, slowly bloomed into revelation. My left hand, once a stranger, began to find its rhythm, moving in quiet harmony with my right, complementing it in ways I never expected."

                    "text"  : "In middle school, I discovered my love for baseball, and with it, a deep fascination for the left-handed advantage. Left-handed athletes, I learned, possess tactical advantages—unfamiliar angles that throw opponents off balance, movements that seem to catch them just a fraction too late. Baseball is no exception, where left-handed batters are gifted with one step closer to first base, and lefty pitchers have a sharper edge on pick-offs. Growing up in Taiwan, where many left-handed kids were retrained to use their right, my entire team batted right-handed. But I saw an opportunity. I bet they’ve never faced a left-handed hitter, I thought, as I stepped into the batter’s box, feeling both out of place and electric with possibility. That small shift caught the pitchers by surprise, unraveling their rhythm. By the end of the season, this peculiar experiment culminated in the highest walk rate and on-base percentage—the “left-handed experiment” quietly triumphant. From there, I started embracing this newfound duality in sports—ping-pong, archery—and soon, my non-dominant hand became not just an option, but an ally in daily life."

With the help of ChatGPT, I dove deep into MacOS, learning its intricate workings—from keychain access to the Carbon API. My goal was simple: to create a second mouse, one for each hand, so they could dance together across the screen. And thus, The Duality of Mouse was born. New cursors materialized, each imbued with the soul of its own mouse. As cherry on top, I incorporated copy-and-paste functionality for text selection and the middle key, transforming my computer screen from a one-man show into a stage where two mice tangoed across the screen in perfect synchronization."
